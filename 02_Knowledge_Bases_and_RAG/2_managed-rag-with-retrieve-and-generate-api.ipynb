    "# Module 2 - Build RAG-powered Q&A Application with **RetrieveAndGenerate API**\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides sample code and step-by-step instructions for building a fully-managed question-answering (Q&A) application using a **RetrieveAndGenerate API** of Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook, we demonstrated how to create a Knowledge Base in Amazon Bedrock — including setting up an S3 data source, configuring an Amazon OpenSearch Serverless (AOSS) vector index, and ingesting documents for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we take the next step: building a Q&A application that can query that Knowledge Base using the `RetrieveAndGenerate` API. This API allows you to retrieve the most relevant content from your Knowledge Base based on a user’s query and automatically pass that information to a foundation model (FM) to generate a grounded, context-aware response.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a classic example of the RAG pattern — where external data is dynamically retrieved at query time and incorporated into the model’s prompt to improve relevance, accuracy, and transparency. In this solution, retrieved knowledge base content comes with source attribution, helping end users understand the origin of the response and minimizing the risk of model hallucinations.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 2. Fully-managed RAG with **RetreiveAndGenerate API**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `RetrieveAndGenerate` API provides a fully managed way to implement the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern with Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a user submits a query, the API automatically converts the query into vector embeddings, performs a similarity search against the Knowledge Base, and retrieves the most relevant document chunks. These search results are then injected into the foundation model's prompt as additional context, enabling the model to generate more accurate and grounded responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "For multi-turn conversations, Knowledge Bases also maintain short-term conversational memory — allowing the API to return more contextually relevant answers across a dialogue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the `RetrieveAndGenerate` API includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **generated response** from the foundation model\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Source attribution** metadata for the retrieved content\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **actual retrieved text chunks** from the Knowledge Base\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes it easy to build RAG-powered applications with trusted, explainable answers — without having to manage retrieval pipelines or prompt construction yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Retrieve and Generate Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s now see the `RetrieveAndGenerate` API in action and showcase a fully managed RAG workflow in Amazon Bedrock.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we’ll use the Knowledge Base built in the previous lab — containing Amazon Shareholder Letters — to demonstrate how the API retrieves relevant information and generates a grounded response to a user query."

      " Amazon employs technology extensively to enhance customer service and experience. Here are some key areas where Amazon uses technology to better serve its customers:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Fulfillment Network and Delivery Speed**: Amazon has been innovating in its fulfillment network for decades, constantly trying to shorten the time to get items to customers. The regionalization redesign of its fulfillment network, new placement algorithms, and innovative same-day fulfillment centers have significantly improved delivery speeds. Amazon Prime now offers tens of millions of items available in one day or better, and an increasing number of deliveries happen same day. Amazon is also planning to use drones (Prime Air) to deliver items inside an hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Customer and Seller Service Productivity Apps**: Amazon is building a substantial number of GenAI applications across every Amazon consumer business. These range from AI-powered shopping assistants like Rufus to customer and seller service productivity apps.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Advertising Capabilities**: Amazon uses GenAI to make it simple with natural language prompts to generate, customize, and edit high-quality images, advertising copy, and videos.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Project Kuiper**: To help the hundreds of millions of people without broadband connectivity, Amazon has launched Project Kuiper, a low Earth orbit satellite network. The company believes Kuiper will be a meaningful operating income and ROIC business for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **AWS Services**: Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a set of primitives that democratize the next seminal phase of AI. AWS services, at all three layers of the stack, will empower internal and external builders to transform virtually every customer experience that we know (and invent altogether new ones as well).\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Amazon Q**: Amazon Q is an expert on AWS that writes, debugs, tests, and implements code, while also doing transformations and querying customers’ various data repositories to answer questions, summarize data, carry on coherent conversation, and take action.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Amazon Future Engineer**: To ensure that future generations have the skills they need to thrive in a technology-driven economy, Amazon started a program called Amazon Future Engineer. The program is designed to educate and train low-income and disadvantaged young people to pursue careers in computer science.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Alexa**: Amazon has over 600 million Alexa devices out there today, and expects Alexa+ to play an even more vital role in the lives of these hundreds of millions of customers in the future.\n",

Bezos' 2022 letter, while also discussing innovation, focuses more on the historical context and the achievements of Amazon over the years.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Personal Anecdotes**: In the 2022 letter, Bezos includes personal anecdotes and reflections on the journey of Amazon, such as the creation of Prime, Marketplace, and the impact of AWS. Jassy's 2023 letter does not include such personal anecdotes but rather focuses on the strategic direction and future opportunities.\n",

      "In summary, while both letters reflect the leadership styles of their respective authors, Jassy's 2023 letter is more forward-looking and optimistic, focusing on innovation and future growth, whereas Bezos' 2022 letter provides a more reflective look at Amazon's history and achievements.\n"

In the 25 years I\\u2019ve been at Amazon, there has been constant change, much of which we\\u2019ve initiated ourselves. When I joined Amazon in 1997, we had booked $15M in revenue in 1996, were a books-only retailer, did not have a third-party marketplace, and only shipped to addresses in the US. Today, Amazon sells nearly every physical and digital retail item you can imagine, with a vibrant third-party seller ecosystem that accounts for 60% of our unit sales, and reaches customers in virtually every country around the world. Similarly, building a business around a set of technology infrastructure services in the cloud was not obvious in 2003 when we started pursuing AWS, and still wasn\\u2019t when we launched our first services in 2006. Having virtually every book at your fingertips in 60 seconds, and then being able to store and retrieve them on a lightweight digital reader was not \\u201ca thing\\u201d yet when we launched Kindle in 2007, nor was a voice-driven personal assistant like Alexa (launched in 2014) that you could use to access entertainment, control your smart home, shop, and retrieve all sorts of information.

I noted that Amazon had grown from having 158 employees to 614, and that we had surpassed 1.5 million customer accounts. We had just gone public at a split-adjusted stock price of $1.50 per share. I wrote that it was Day 1.     We\\u2019ve come a long way since then, and we are working harder than ever to serve and delight customers. Last year, we hired 500,000 employees and now directly employ 1.3 million people around the world. We have more than 200 million Prime members worldwide. More than 1.9 million small and medium-sized businesses sell in our store, and they make up close to 60% of our retail sales. Customers have connected more than 100 million smart home devices to Alexa. AmazonWeb Services serves millions of customers and ended 2020 with a $50 billion annualized run rate. In 1997, we hadn\\u2019t invented Prime, Marketplace, Alexa, or AWS. They weren\\u2019t even ideas then, and none was preordained. We took great risk with each one and put sweat and ingenuity into each one.     Along the way, we\\u2019ve created $1.6 trillion of wealth for shareowners. Who are they? Your Chair is one, and my Amazon shares have made me wealthy. But more than 7/8ths of the shares, representing $1.4 trillion of wealth creation, are owned by others. Who are they? They\\u2019re pension funds, universities, and 401(k)s, and they\\u2019re Mary and Larry, who sent me this note out of the blue just as I was sitting down to write this shareholder letter:I am approached with similar stories all the time. I know people who\\u2019ve used their Amazon money for college, for emergencies, for houses, for vacations, to start their own business, for charity \\u2013 and the list goes on. I\\u2019m proud of the wealth we\\u2019ve created for shareowners. It\\u2019s significant, and it improves their lives. But I also know something else: it\\u2019s not the largest part of the value we\\u2019ve created.     Create More Than You Consume     If you want to be successful in business (in life, actually), you have to create more than you consume.\",\n",

I noted that Amazon had grown from having 158 employees to 614, and that we had surpassed 1.5 million customer accounts. We had just gone public at a split-adjusted stock price of $1.50 per share. I wrote that it was Day 1.     We\\u2019ve come a long way since then, and we are working harder than ever to serve and delight customers. Last year, we hired 500,000 employees and now directly employ 1.3 million people around the world. We have more than 200 million Prime members worldwide. More than 1.9 million small and medium-sized businesses sell in our store, and they make up close to 60% of our retail sales. Customers have connected more than 100 million smart home devices to Alexa. AmazonWeb Services serves millions of customers and ended 2020 with a $50 billion annualized run rate. In 1997, we hadn\\u2019t invented Prime, Marketplace, Alexa, or AWS. They weren\\u2019t even ideas then, and none was preordained. We took great risk with each one and put sweat and ingenuity into each one.     Along the way, we\\u2019ve created $1.6 trillion of wealth for shareowners. Who are they? Your Chair is one, and my Amazon shares have made me wealthy. But more than 7/8ths of the shares, representing $1.4 trillion of wealth creation, are owned by others. Who are they? They\\u2019re pension funds, universities, and 401(k)s, and they\\u2019re Mary and Larry, who sent me this note out of the blue just as I was sitting down to write this shareholder letter:I am approached with similar stories all the time. I know people who\\u2019ve used their Amazon money for college, for emergencies, for houses, for vacations, to start their own business, for charity \\u2013 and the list goes on. I\\u2019m proud of the wealth we\\u2019ve created for shareowners. It\\u2019s significant, and it improves their lives. But I also know something else: it\\u2019s not the largest part of the value we\\u2019ve created.     Create More Than You Consume     If you want to be successful in business (in life, actually), you have to create more than you consume.\",\n",

    "In this notebook, we built a fully-managed RAG-powered Q&A application using the `RetrieveAndGenerate` API from Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases.\n",
    "\n",
    "We demonstrated how this API simplifies the RAG workflow by automatically retrieving relevant content from a knowledge base and generating grounded, context-aware responses using a foundation model. The responses also include source references, allowing users to easily trace answers back to the original documents.\n",

    "This approach enables you to quickly build reliable, transparent Q&A solutions without managing the complexity of prompt engineering or retrieval logic manually.\n",

    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are looking for more flexibility and control over your RAG workflow, Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases also provides a `Retrieve` API. This API allows you to perform semantic and/or keyword search over your knowledge base and retrieve the most relevant document chunks, which you can then use to build custom prompts or workflows tailored to your application needs.\n",
