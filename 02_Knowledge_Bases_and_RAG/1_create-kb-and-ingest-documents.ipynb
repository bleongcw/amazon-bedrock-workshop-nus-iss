    "Foundation models (FMs) are powerful AI models trained on vast amounts of general-purpose data. However, many real-world applications require these models to generate responses grounded in domain-specific or proprietary information. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances generative AI responses by retrieving relevant information from external data sources at query time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases (BKBs) provide a fully managed capability to implement RAG-based solutions. By integrating your own data — such as documents, manuals, and other domain-specific sources of information — into a knowledge base, you can improve the accuracy, relevance, and usefulness of model-generated responses. When a user submits a query, Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases search across the available data sources, retrieve the most relevant content, and pass this information to the foundation model to generate a more informed response.\n",

We started by setting up the environment, installing the required libraries, and initializing the necessary AWS service clients. Then, we created an Amazon S3 bucket to store unstructured data (PDF documents) and uploaded sample files. We proceeded by provisioning an Amazon OpenSearch Serverless (AOSS) collection and index, configuring the appropriate IAM roles and permissions, and granting access to the BKB. Finally, we created the BKB, connected it to the S3 data source, and synchronized the documents to generate vector embeddings, which were stored in AOSS."
